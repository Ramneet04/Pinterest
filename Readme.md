# Pinterest Clone Project
- before starting project i go through some concepts like data association -> linking one model to other model via thier id's known as data association, so that we can establise a relation between them.

## what roadmap i followed
- "/" where one can login or sign up.
- "/profile" where one can see his/her profile and can see the post which he has saved, and there is a section of upload too.
- "/feed" here all images getting shown.
- images are clickable amd can be opened when clicked and one can save it.
- "/board/:boardname" where board is gonna shown.

### faced error 
- initial error as i made a route that does nothing a open route and got an error server was crashing took my more than a hour.
- missed a / in login route.
